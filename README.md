Chocolate Factory
=================

A simple web application based off of the logic from Coding Bat's "make chocolate" logic problem: http://codingbat.com/prob/p191363

Coding Bat directions
---------------------

"We want make a package of goal kilos of chocolate. We have small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each). Return the number of small
bars to use, assuming we always use big bars before small bars. Return -1 if it can't be done."

My App
------

We extended the problem to include the number of large bars of chocolate in the solution as well. I created a front-end using AngularJS to
allow the user to enter the amounts of chocolate they have (small and large) and how much they want (goal) and to display the chocolate in
their inventory as well as in the solution.
